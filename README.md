# fish-freshness-classifier
This repository contains a neural network model for classifying whether a fish is fresh or not based on a dataset of 7997 fish images. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and automated system to determine the freshness of fish, which can be useful for various applications in the fishing industry, seafood markets, and restaurants.

# [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P9-SA_SOuB7wjx7uGWcuM0QNfFE2ID-Y?usp=share_link)
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of 7997 high-resolution fish images, captured from various sources. The images are labeled with corresponding freshness labels: fresh or not fresh. Each image is preprocessed and augmented to enhance the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.

# Model Architecture
The classification model is built using deep learning techniques, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN is designed to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from the fish images, capturing both low-level and high-level representations. Multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers are utilized to create an effective classifier.

# Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using a combination of supervised learning techniques and state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The training process involves iteratively adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the classification error. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to ensure robustness and reliability.

# Usage
This repository provides code and documentation for training and using the fresh fish classifier model. It includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. Detailed instructions are provided to guide users through the entire process, from setting up the environment to deploying the trained model for inference.
